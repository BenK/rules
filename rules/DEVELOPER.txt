Some notes for developers working on the rules code
---------------------------------------------------

Terminology & Overview
-----------------------
  * Rules plugins extend the "rules language". Thus conditions and actions are
    implemented with a plugin, but also loops or ORs are plugins. Each plugin is
    declared to be used in the condition or the action part - specified by the
    interface.
  * The action and condition plugin are a so called "AbstractPlugin" which means
    they have to be implemented by modules to be actually usable. This is not
    the case for loops or ORs.
  * Thus any rule element is an instance of a RulesPlugin. 
  * A rules configuration consists of multiple rule elements while one is the
    parent, which may be a 'rule' but also any other plugin.
  * Each rules configuration may be persistently saved to the db using the
    entity CRUD API. Using the API on contained rule elements is working too and
    results in the whole configuration being updated.
